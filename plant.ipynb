When set to `True`, yggdrasil turns of several safe guards that increase run-time. These include things like checking data formats and validating inputs/outputs to/from framework components. It is highly recommended, that `production_run` is only set to `True` when you are done testing an integration and are ready for a \"production run\" that requires higher performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splitting Calls\n",
    "As you may remember from the introduction, client and timesync \"calls\" are really a combination of a send and receive (sending the request and receiving the response). If call's take a long amount of time, we can split the call into its components to take advantage of the parallelism yggdrasil offers. A client or timesync comm can call send, finish another unrelated task while the server/sync operation takes place, and then call receive to get the response. For example, the synchronization call to the root model in the previous example could be split between a send and receive call::"
